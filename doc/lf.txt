INTRODUCTION                                                           *lf.vim*

Lf.vim is a simple and stupid plugin to open the Lf file manager inside Vim
and using it to change the Vim `cwd` and selecting files. It's implemented
entirely in Vim Script

NOTE: Of course, the plugin will not work if you don't have the Lf file
manager installed. See their GitHub page for information on their side:

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                            *lf.vim-usage*

The plugin implements three new commands: the main one is |Lf|, used to open
Lf inside the default Vim |terminal|. After selecting a file, it'll open
inside the current Vim window. If the variable |g:lf_change_cwd| is setted to
1, it'll also change the Vim `cwd` to the last directory of Lf.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                      *lf.vim-commands*

*Lf*
Opens Lf inside a |terminal|.

*LfChangeCwd*
Same, but will change the Vim `cwd` anyway, ignoring the |g:lf_change_cwd|
variable.

*LfNoChangeCwd*
Same, but will NOT change the Vim `cwd`, ignoring the |g:lf_change_cwd|
variable.

==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                      *lf.vim-settings*

*g:lf_change_cwd*       If 0 (default), |Lf| will not change the Vim `cwd` by
                      default. If 1, it'll change.

*g:lf_hijack_netrw*     If 1 (default), |Lf| will hijack netrw, becaming the
                      default to explore directories. If 0, |Lf| will not 
                      hijack netrw. 

*g:lf_change_cwd_cmd*   Defines the Vim |cd| command. Defaults to |cd|.
